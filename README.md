###About

This repository is a compilation of programs, scripts, and pdf manuals I(Bryce Guinta) used for [Manitou FIRST Robotics](http://manitourobotics.com) summer camp.



###How to use

You need to download NQC( http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/ ) if you wish to deploy my NQC programs using

    nqc -Trcx2 -Susb -d <program-name>

or look in the scripts folder at deploy.sh which you can just run in the current directory. 

    ./deploy

I'm assuming that you're using the RCX2.0 with a USB infrared tower.
