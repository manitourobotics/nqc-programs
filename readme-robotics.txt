Being able to send to the RCX bricks on some systems(Win7-32bit) is tricky and impossible on 64-bit systems. First of all, you have to uninstall any drivers that may have been installed for the IR tower( check the device manager under lego usb tower). Unplug the IR tower. Then, follow the Mindstorms disc until you get an error. After that, you need to install Vista drivers for the IR tower( http://cache.lego.com/downloads/education/tower164.zip )
After you install those drivers, run Mindstorms in compatibility mode and you will( hope fully ) be able to see communication between the RCX and the tower.
